## How to run RenderTune locally:
- Clone this repo and cd into the folder.
- Run `npm i` and `npm i -g electron` if you haven't already installed electron globally.
- If you are on windows I recommend using command prompt, as that can launch electron apps fine, while Windows Linux Subsystem has troubles launching electron apps.
- If you are on a mac using the mac terminal, download brew and `ffmpeg-mac/` by following the instructions below.
- Download and setup `ffmpeg-mac/` folder (instructions below).
- Run `electron .` to start the program.

## How to install ffmpeg locally for mac (`ffmpeg-mac/`)
- If you are on mac; run `sh buildffmpeg.sh` to create the `ffmpeg-mac/` folder and statically build a version of ffmpeg that can be sandboxed and distributed to the mac apple store (mas).
- Verify your local `ffmpeg-mac/` folder has no dynamic libraries by running this command: 
`otool -L ffmpeg-mac/ffmpeg | grep /usr/local`
- If any files show up after running this command, delete or move those files, redownload the ffmpeg-mac/ folder, then run the 'otool' command again to verify there are no dynamic libraries in your local ffmpeg-mac/ folder. 

## Releasing a new version:
- Change version number in package.json (this is the bare minimum to change).
- Make sure you have local vars set for GH_TOKEN, APPLEID, and APPLEIDPASS.
- Mac: 
    - Download and setup `ffmpeg-mac/` folder.
    - Mac Apple Store: Change package.json mac build targets to only contain `"mas"`, verify the paths in `signmasscript.sh` are correct, then build & sign by running the command `npm run build-mas`. Upload the outputted RenderTune.pkg file to App Store Connect using Transporter, then create a new Mac Apple Store submission for review.
    - Mac .dmg Installer (auto-updates): Change package.json build targets to contain `"dmg", "zip"`, remove the RenderTune.pkg file we crated for MAS in the above step if it exists since we don't want to package that inside our build. Build & publish by running the command `npm run build-mac-publish`.
- Windows:
    - To sign a .appx build for the Windows Store you need to have a Windows SDK downloaded: https://www.electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/windows-store-guide.
    - Windows Installer (auto-updates), Windows Portable, and Windows Store .appx: On Windows, make sure env vars are set by running `echo %GH_TOKEN%` in command prompt terminal, build nsis-web/portable/appx targets with the command `npm run build-win-publish`. To sign the Windows Store Build, make sure you are on a computer with the powershell electron-windows-store requirements, and then run the following powershell command to generate a signed .appx file that you can upload to the Microsoft Store review system:
```
electron-windows-store --input-directory C:\Users\marti\Documents\projects\RenderTune\dist\win-unpacked --output-directory C:\Users\marti\Documents\projects\Appx --package-version 0.5.0.0 --package-name RenderTune --package-display-name 'RenderTune' --publisher-display-name 'martinbarker' --identity-name 1845martinbarker.digify -a C:\Users\marti\Documents\projects\RenderTune\Resources\
```
- Linux: 
    - Login to snap store from terminal: `$ snapcraft login`. Build & publish linux builds for snap and AppImage: `$ npm run build-linux-publish`. This will output a .snap file in the dist/ folder that you can upload using the command: `$ snapcraft upload --release=stable dist/rendertune_0.3.23_amd64.snap` (make sure your .snap filename is correct).
- Once all of the following steps have been followed, there should be a new RenderTune version drafted on GitHub with files uploaded for Mac, Windows, and Linux.

## Roadmap:
This list is of future updates / improvements I plan to make for RenderTune (If you can think of any features you would like, contact me and I will include them in the roadmap)
- UI Improvements: Better render status options, more efficent code.
- Add API to electron app so you can trigger renders using POST route.
- New Feature: Append/Prepend video file to video we are rendering (Add MP4 intro/outro, add MP3 intro/outro)
- New Feautre: Record, split, export and tag audio files.
- New Feature: Upload files to YouTube / tag

### How to setup Mac Apple Store signing:

- Need to set the following GitHub actions secret values:
```
APPLE_API_KEY_ID
APPLE_API_ISSUER
APPLE_API_KEY
MAC_CERTS
MAC_CERTS_PASSWORD
PROVISIONING_PROFILE_BASE64
SNAPCRAFT_TOKEN
```
- Usefull links for getting MAS/Mac credentials:
    - https://github.com/marketplace/actions/electron-builder-action
    - https://samuelmeuli.com/blog/2019-12-28-notarizing-your-electron-app/
